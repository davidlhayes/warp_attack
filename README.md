# Warp Attack

# Project Description

Warp Attack is a board game to be played by two human players. Input is movement of pieces with a mouse or a finger (on applicable devices).

## Scope

A complete game must be playable with players using separate computers.

### Potential Extras

1. A messaging pane
A very simple display of strings that each user adds to the database. Highly desired

2. A PC play mode.
At it's most basic, an AI player must be able to make legal moves. It is not realistic for me to craft an AI player that considers things such as the other player's skill or anticipate moves two turns ahead, BUT I intend to at least store information that would make future development easier. For example, after a successful attack, the victor continues play, but with a known rank. Strategy is obviously affected.

3. A sign-in to allow more than one game at a time.

# User Stories

Warp Attack is a clone of Stratego, but with starships (in the vein of Star Trek) in place of the traditional Eurpoean army archetypes. A player can:

1. Press New Game
2. Choose a Color
3. Tray fills with your pieces
4. Move pieces to your starting field
5. Opponents pieces are represented as 'blanks' or a simple logo.
6. App will indicate Ready, Reset Pieces, or Cancel
7. When your turn is indicated "Red Move/Blue Move", move a
piece.
  - A legal move to an empty space changes XXX Move to XXX Move indicator.
  - An illegal move just returns the piece to its origin
  - An attack presents the opponents as large representations of the tokens and then fades the loser.
8. When a user enters text in the message box and clicks send, the message is append to the list.
